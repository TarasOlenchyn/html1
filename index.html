    <h1>ELON MUSK BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a South African-born American entrepreneur
    and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
    SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003.
    Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
    Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012,
    when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle
    to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of
    SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking
    on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.</p>
